### Exercise 7: Communicating Experimental Insights

Now we need to translate your analytical results into a short executive brief written for a business audience.

Your goal is to communicate *what was tested*, *what happened*, and *what the company should do next* — clearly and persuasively, without technical detail.

::: {.callout-warning}
### Instructions

**Length:** 400 words.  
**Exhibit:** 1 table **or** figure.  

Write this as an **executive brief** to be read and understood by managers.

- Bullets must be written as **full sentences**.  
- Use the writing principles from *Write Like an Amazonian* — short, declarative sentences; clarity before style.  
- **No visible code** in the brief.  
- Do **not** produce new analysis, tables, or figures in this section — use the results already created in Exercises 5–6.  
:::

INSERT YOUR FIGURE OR TABLE HERE  
*(For example: your completion-rate comparison chart or summary table from Exercise 5.)*

### Executive Summary

3–4 sentences summarising the research question, key findings, and why they matter for the company.  
*Hint:* State the business problem, the intervention, and the observed difference in completion rates.

### Key Insights

- Up to **3 bullets** describing what the data and analysis show.  
- Focus on evidence — e.g., “Completion rates were 3.7 percentage points higher in the Test group.”  
- Avoid statistical jargon; use plain, business‐relevant language.

### Business Implications

- Up to **3 bullets** on why these findings matter for the organisation.  
- Connect the analytics result back to strategic goals.

### Recommended Actions

- Up to **3 bullets** outlining clear, actionable next steps.  
- Recommendations should be specific, realistic, and aligned with business priorities.

🎯 **Learning Objective**

Students should:

- Synthesise analytic findings into a concise, business-facing narrative.  
- Translate statistical results into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.  
- Distinguish between *facts*, *insights*, and *implications*.  
- Practise structured executive communication (summary → insight → implication → action).

✅ **Core Concepts to Highlight**

- **Data-to-decision storytelling:** Executives want to know what happened, why it matters, and what to do — not how it was coded.  
- **Evidence phrased in business terms:** Replace analytical detail (e.g., “effect size of 0.08 SD”) with performance language (e.g., “a measurable lift in customer conversion”).  
- **Structure matters:**  
  - *Executive Summary* = the key message in 3–4 sentences.  
  - *Key Insights* = what the data reveal (specific, declarative).  
  - *Business Implications* = why it matters strategically.  
  - *Recommended Actions* = what should happen next.  
- **Tone:** Confident, factual, and audience-aware. Write as if the VP of Product will skim it between meetings.  
- **One exhibit only:** Encourage visual economy — one figure or table that reinforces the story.

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

- “What separates a *data fact* from a *business insight*?”  
- “How could you phrase this same result so that a non-analyst understands why it matters?”  
- “If you were the VP of Product, which single line here would convince you to act?”  
- “What verbs sound decisive and executive? (‘increased,’ ‘reduced,’ ‘enabled,’ ‘drove’).”  
- “How might you reword a technical statement like ‘0.08 SD difference’ into something a manager actually remembers?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- **Listing results instead of interpreting them.**  
  Students often repeat metrics rather than explaining what they *mean* for the business.  
- **Overusing technical terms.**  
  Phrases like “significant at p < 0.05” or “standard deviation units” should be translated into plain English.  
- **Neglecting implications.**  
  A good brief doesn’t stop at “what happened” — it ends with “so what?” and “what next?”.  
- **Forgetting scale.**  
  Remind students that small effects can have big business value; connect percentage points to customer counts or revenue potential.

### Example Executive Brief — Funnel Completion A/B Test

INSERT YOUR FIGURE OR TABLE HERE  
*(Example: Bar chart showing 65.6 % vs 69.3 % completion rates.)*

### Executive Summary (5 pts)

The company tested a new sign-up flow for existing users who needed to activate access to the new personalised-insights dashboard.
Random assignment split users between the **Control** (old flow) and **Test** (new flow).
The new flow increased completion rates from **65.6 % to 69.3 %**, a **3.7 percentage-point** or **5.6 %** relative improvement. 
This increase represents a meaningful uplift at scale and validates the design changes introduced.

### Key Insights (5 pts)

- The **new sign-up flow increased completion rates by 3.7 percentage points**, moving nearly 6 % more users through the funnel.  
- The effect is **consistent with high-performing digital experiments** — modest in size but highly impactful across large user base.  
- Incremental UX improvements can deliver measurable gains in customer conversion, underscoring the ROI of ongoing experimentation.

### Business Implications

- A smoother sign-up experience helps more customers access premium features sooner, improving perceived value and engagement.  
- Higher completion reduces churn risk among existing users who might otherwise abandon the process.  
- Demonstrates that small UX improvements can deliver measurable performance gains in high-volume digital channels.


### Recommended Actions

- **Roll out** the new sign-up process to all users, prioritising markets with similar user profiles.  
- **Monitor** long-term engagement and retention metrics to confirm sustained impact beyond initial sign-up.  
- (Maybe) **Design a follow-up test** to identify which interface changes (layout, copy, or step order) drove the largest improvement.
