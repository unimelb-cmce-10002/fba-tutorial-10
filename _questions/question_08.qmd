### Exercise 8: Understanding Mid-Funnel Outcomes

After reviewing your executive brief, one manager comments:

> “This tells me how many users finished the sign-up flow — but I want to understand what happened in the middle.  
> Where exactly are we gaining or losing customers?”

**(a)** What does the manager mean by “mid-funnel outcomes”?  
How are these different from overall completion rates?

**(b)** Why might focusing only on completions hide important insights about customer experience or friction points?

**(c)** Intuitively, how could you use the same event-level data to explore mid-funnel performance?  
Describe two or three possible ways (e.g., visual summaries or simple metrics) without writing any code.

**(d)** What kinds of business questions could mid-funnel analysis help answer that top-line completion rates cannot?

**(a)**
“Mid-funnel outcomes” refer to the intermediate steps users take before reaching the final confirmation — such as start → step 1 → step 2 → confirm.
Instead of only asking who finished, the manager wants to know where users drop off or loop back inside the process.

**(b)**
Completion rates compress all behaviour into one number.
If the new flow shortens some steps but adds friction elsewhere, the total completion may mask these differences.
Understanding where users abandon or hesitate reveals why the experiment succeeded or failed.

**(c)**
Possible intuitive approaches (that are feasible with this data):

- Step-level conversion chart: show the percentage of users moving from each step to the next (e.g., 100 % start → 90 % step 1 → 75 % step 2 → 69 % confirm).
- Drop-off table or waterfall plot: visualise where the biggest losses occur.
- “Go-back” rate: count how often users return to earlier steps as a proxy for confusion or friction.
- Average steps completed: compare how far users get, on average, before quitting.

**(d)** 
Mid-funnel analysis helps answer:

- Which specific steps drive most attrition?
- Are some user segments or variations struggling at certain points?
- Does the new design make early steps easier but later ones harder?
- Where should UX or communication changes be prioritised next?
