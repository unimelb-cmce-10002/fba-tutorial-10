### Exercise 1: Understanding the Business Context

Before we start analysing the data, take a step back and think about the business motivation behind this experiment.

The company has introduced a new personalised insights dashboard ‚Äî but to use it, existing customers need to go through an additional sign-up process.  
From a business perspective, this is a risky move: any new step in the customer journey could add friction and cause users to drop off before completion.

In marketing and product analytics, we often visualise this process as a **funnel** ‚Äî a series of steps users move through on their way to a goal (for example, from *start* to *confirm*).  
Each step represents a decision point where users can continue or abandon the process.

(a) Why might the company have decided to test a new sign-up flow rather than simply launching it for everyone?  
(b) What kinds of outcomes or trade-offs should the company be paying attention to?  
(c) What can a funnel tell us about customer behaviour that a simple completion rate cannot?  
(d) In this experiment, what would "success" look like from both the company‚Äôs and the customer‚Äôs perspective?

üéØ **Learning Objective**  

Students should:  
- Understand why companies use experiments (A/B tests) before rolling out product changes.  
- Recognize how funnels represent a customer journey as a sequence of decision points.
- Explain how funnels help diagnose *where* and *why* users drop off.  
- Distinguish between business and customer perspectives when defining ‚Äúsuccess.‚Äù  
- Appreciate the importance of balancing completion outcomes with user experience.

‚úÖ **Core Concepts to Highlight**

- **What a funnel is:**  
  A visual or conceptual model showing how many users remain at each stage of a process.  
  It narrows from ‚Äúeveryone who starts‚Äù to ‚Äúthose who finish.‚Äù  
  Each level shows a *decision point* where people can continue or abandon the journey.

- **Why funnels matter:**  
  - Reveal *where* users drop off, not just *how many* finish.  
  - Help identify friction, confusion, or barriers in multi-step processes.  
  - Allow teams to measure both efficiency (speed) and effectiveness (completion).

- **Experimental design as risk management:**  
  Testing before rollout reduces uncertainty and prevents company-wide friction.  

- **Metrics beyond completion:**  
  Funnels expose behavioural patterns‚Äîretries, go-backs, hesitations‚Äîthat a single completion rate hides.

- **Trade-offs:**  
  Improving completion may come with greater effort or time per user.

- **Dual perspectives:**  
  - **Company:** success = more conversions with manageable friction.  
  - **Customer:** success = an easy, trustworthy, low-effort experience.

üí¨ **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

- ‚ÄúIf you imagine the sign-up flow as a funnel, what might the steps be?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhy does every step lose some users? What kinds of things make people drop off?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúCan a company have a high completion rate but still have a bad funnel?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhere have you personally experienced a frustrating online process that made you restart?‚Äù

üìå **Common Misunderstandings**

- Thinking of a funnel as a purely visual chart rather than a behavioural model.  
- Assuming users move linearly through steps‚Äîreal funnels can include loops and retries.  
- Believing that higher completion automatically equals a better experience.  
- Overlooking early-step friction because final completion looks strong.

#### (a) Why might the company have decided to test a new sign-up flow rather than simply launching it for everyone?

- **Risk management:** A/B testing reduces the risk of rolling out a design that might increase friction or reduce usage.  
- **Evidence-based decision-making:** Testing allows the company to observe actual behavioural responses (completion, engagement) before committing.  
- **Customer experience protection:** A poorly designed flow could frustrate users or lead to churn; testing isolates that risk to a smaller group.  
- **Learning opportunity:** The experiment helps uncover why people drop off ‚Äî not just whether they do ‚Äî enabling refinement before a full launch.

#### (b) What kinds of outcomes or trade-offs should the company be paying attention to?

- **Completion vs. friction:** Does the new flow make it easier to complete, or does it add steps or confusion?  
- **Engagement vs. effort:** Higher completion might come at the cost of users spending longer or going back more often.  
- **Short-term vs. long-term value:** Even if completion rises now, will users continue to engage with the new dashboard later?  
- **User perception:** Frustrating experiences can damage trust in a financial product, even if eventual completion is high.

#### (c) What can a funnel tell us about customer behaviour that a simple completion rate cannot?

- **Where** users drop off (step-level insight, not just overall success/failure).  
- **How** users move through the process ‚Äî for example, skipping, looping, or hesitating.  
- **Severity of friction points:** Identifies which steps drive the biggest loss or confusion.  
- **Improvement opportunities:** Helps prioritise UX fixes that have the largest payoff.

#### (d) In this experiment, what would ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù look like from both the company‚Äôs and the customer‚Äôs perspective?

| Perspective | Success Definition |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Company** | More users complete the new sign-up and reach the dashboard with minimal increase in time or re-engagement effort. |
| **Customer** | The process feels intuitive, quick ‚Äî they gain access to the new feature without frustration or confusion. |
