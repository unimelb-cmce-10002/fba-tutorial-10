## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

By the end of this tutorial, students should be able to:

-  Describe how experiments help evaluate product or design changes.  
- Join and prepare experimental and event-level datasets to compute key outcomes such as funnel completion rates.  
-  Compare and interpret results across variations, expressing differences in both percentage points and relative terms, and evaluating whether they are meaningful in a business context.  
- Communicate analytic findings in clear, decision-oriented language suitable for a managerial audience, using one concise table or figure.
